THE 184-INCH SYNCHROCYCLOTRON</h3>


<p>His success with the 60-inch cyclotron in 1939 led Dr.
E. O. Lawrence to propose a much more powerful accelerator,
one which could produce new types of nuclear rearrangements
and even create particles. Grants totaling
$1,225,000 permitted work to start on the 184-inch cyclotron
in August 1940.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
It was designed to accelerate atomic
particles to an energy of 100 million electron volts (Mev),
five times that possible with the 60-inch machine.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 1. The electromagnet under construction during the

</div>

<p>Before the new cyclotron could be finished World War
II began. Construction on the cyclotron was therefore
halted. However, because of interest in separating the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>isotopes of uranium by the electromagnetic method, work
on the giant magnet continued at an even faster pace. This
magnet would contain 3700 tons of steel in its yoke and
pole pieces, and 300 tons of copper in its exciting coils
(Fig. 1). By May 1942 the magnet was completed. During
that summer it was used in a pilot plant to separate the
first significant amounts of U<sup>235</sup> ever obtained. The 184-inch
magnet remained in use in a research and development
program at Berkeley until the end of the war, supplying
information to Oak Ridge, Tennessee, where a large
separation plant had been erected.</p>

<p>Construction on the rest of the cyclotron was resumed
in 1945. By that time a new principle had been discovered
which made it possible to obtain ion beams of much higher
energy than originally hoped for. Yet a considerably lower
accelerating voltage could be used. This important discovery
was made independently by Dr. V. Veksler in
Russia and by Dr. Edwin M. McMillan, present Director
of the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory. Before attempting
to discuss this principle, we should first review the operation
of a conventional cyclotron.</p>

<h3><a name="PRINCIPLE_OF_OPERATION" id="PRINCIPLE_OF_OPERATION"></a>
PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION OF A CONVENTIONAL CYCLOTRON</h3>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

</a>
<span class="caption">Fig. 2. Basic parts of a cyclotron.</span>
</div>

<p>The main parts of a cyclotron are represented in Fig. 2.
Charged particles (ions) are accelerated inside an evacuated
tank. This is to prevent the beam from colliding with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>air molecules and being scattered. The vacuum tank is
placed between the poles of an electromagnet, whose field
bends the ion beam into a circular orbit.</p>

<p>The operation begins when the ions are introduced into
the region between two accelerating electrodes, or "dees."<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
Because the ions carry a positive electric charge, they
are attracted toward that dee which is electrically negative
at the moment. Were it not for the magnetic field, the
ions would be accelerated in a straight line; instead they
are deflected into a circular path back toward the dee gap.
By the time the ions again reach the dee gap, the sign of
the electric potential on the dees is reversed, so that now
the ions are attracted toward the opposite dee.</p>

<p>As this process of alternating the electric potential is
repeated, the ions gain speed and energy with each revolution.
This causes them to spiral outward. Finally they
strike a target inserted into their path or are extracted
from the cyclotron for use as an external beam.</p>

<p>The time required for an ion to complete one loop
remains constant as it spirals outward. This is because
its velocity increases sufficiently to make up for the
increased distance it travels during each turn. This means
that the electric potential applied to the dees must alternate
at a constant frequency, called the "resonant frequency."</p>

<p>The resonant frequency f is given by the relationship</p>

<table summary="Equation 1" class="equation"><tr>
  <td class="half">&nbsp;</td>
  <td>f &nbsp;=&nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
  <td align="center">He<hr class="eqn" />2 &pi; m c</td>
  <td class="half">&nbsp;</td>
  <td>(1)</td>
</tr></table>

<p>where H, e, &pi;, c, and m are constants. H is the strength
of the magnetic field of the cyclotron, e is the electric
charge carried by the ion, &pi; equals 3.14, c is a conversion
factor, and m is the mass of the ion. For example, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>resonant frequency for protons accelerated in a 15,000-gauss
magnetic field is 23.7 megacycles (Mc).<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
We call
such a rapidly alternating potential a "radiofrequency voltage"
and the electronic circuit for producing it a "radiofrequency
oscillator."</p>

<p>The energy E of an ion emerging from the cyclotron
is given by</p>

<table summary="Equation 2" class="equation"><tr>
  <td class="half">&nbsp;</td>
  <td>E &nbsp;=&nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
  <td align="center">H<sup>2</sup> R<sup>2</sup><hr class="eqn" />2<sup>&nbsp;</sup></td>
  <td align="center">&nbsp;</td>
  <td align="center">e<sup>2</sup><hr class="eqn" />mc<sup>2</sup></td>
  <td class="half">&nbsp;</td>
  <td>(2)</td>
</tr></table>

<p>where H, e, and m are as defined above, and R is the
radius at which the beam is extracted. From this equation
we see that for a given type of ion (where e and m are
constant), the energy depends on the diameter and strength
of the magnet, but not directly upon the voltage applied to
the dees.</p>

<p>The number of revolutions that an ion can make in a
conventional cyclotron is limited to about 70 to 100. This
is due to a very curious effect: as an ion is accelerated,
its mass increases! [This phenomenon is explained by
Einstein's special theory of relativity (see Fig. 3).] Referring
back to Eq. (1), we see that if the ion mass (m)
does not remain constant, but rather increases, then the
resonant frequency (f) decreases. But since the dee potential
continues alternating at a constant frequency, an ion soon
begins to arrive "late" at the dee gap. By the time it has
made about 70 to 100 turns an ion is so badly out of phase
that it is no longer accelerated.</p>

<p>Suppose now that we want to obtain an energy of 10
Mev. Because an ion can make a maximum of about 100
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>turns, the accelerating potential would have to be about
100,000 volts. However, Professor Lawrence hoped to reach
100 Mev with the new 184-inch cyclotron. This meant that
the accelerating voltage would have to be about 1,000,000
volts. Preventing such a high voltage from sparking promised
to be one of many formidable engineering problems.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_PRINCIPLE_OF_PHASE_STABILITY" id="THE_PRINCIPLE_OF_PHASE_STABILITY"></a>
THE PRINCIPLE OF PHASE STABILITY</h3>


<p>Fortunately, Drs. Veksler and McMillan showed that
relatively low dee voltages can be used to accelerate ions
to very high energies. This is possible if the oscillator
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>frequency is continuously decreased to keep it in synchronism
with the decreasing rotational frequency of the ions. This
would allow an ion to make many revolutions without becoming
out of phase. This principle of phase stability
was experimentally verified with the 37-inch cyclotron
before being incorporated into the design of the 184-inch
machine. Because it utilizes this principle, this machine
has usually been referred to as a "synchrocyclotron" or
"frequency-modulated cyclotron." However, it is sometimes
called simply a "cyclotron."</p>

<p>The 184-inch synchrocyclotron was first operated in
November 1946. With a maximum dee voltage of only
20,000 volts, it accelerated deuterons to 190 Mev and
alpha particles to 380 Mev.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
In 1949 it was modified to
permit production of 350-Mev protons also.</p>

<p>Between 1955 and 1957 the synchrocyclotron was rebuilt
so that now the following energies can be obtained:</p>

<table summary="Synchrocylotron energies" class="standard-c">
<tr>
  <td align="center" class="bb">Protons</td>

  <td align="center">730 Mev</td>
  <td align="center">460 Mev</td>
  <td align="center">910 Mev</td>
  <td align="center">1140 Mev</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>In reaching an energy of 730 Mev a proton, for example,
makes 75,000 revolutions in just 6 milliseconds (msec). It
travels a distance of 450 miles and attains a velocity of
152,000 miles per second, or 82% of the speed of light!
During this brief journey its mass increases 75%, giving
very convincing evidence for the validity of Einstein's
theory. Similar data for other ions may be found in the
appendix.</p>

<h3><a name="DESIGN_AND_CONSTRUCTION" id="DESIGN_AND_CONSTRUCTION"></a>
DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF THE 184-INCH SYNCHROCYCLOTRON</h3>


<h4><a name="Magnet" id="Magnet"></a>Magnet</h4>

<p>During the rebuilding of the cyclotron, the diameter of
the magnet pole pieces was increased from 184 to 188-3/4
inches. Also, the pole gap at the center was reduced from
21 to 14 inches. These changes increased the weight of
steel in the magnet from 3700 to 4000 tons.</p>

<p>The main exciting coils, which contain 1300 turns of
copper-bar conductor each, were not altered. Two auxiliary
coils containing 425 turns each were added. This brought
the total weight of copper from 300 to 340 tons. The coils
are layer-wound around the pole pieces close to the pole
gap. Other data about the coils are given in the appendix.</p>

<p>The effect of these modifications was to increase the
field strength at the center of the pole gap from 15,000 to
23,400 gauss. This increase made it possible to obtain the
higher-energy ions.</p>

<p>Power is supplied to the coils by two motor generator
sets, which produce the direct current required for a steady
magnetic field. The direct current from the motor generators
is regulated so that the magnetic-field fluctuation is
less than one part in 10,000. This is necessary if one wants
an external beam of nearly uniform energy.</p>

<p>In order to prevent the beam from becoming unstable
and striking the dee, the magnetic field must be strongest
at the center and decrease radially (Fig. 4a). With flat pole
faces the field does not decrease uniformly. To give the
desired rate of decrease, the pole faces are shimmed with
concentric steel rings of varying thickness, as shown in
Fig. 4b. In a radially decreasing magnetic field, the lines
of magnetic flux bow outward, as represented in Fig. 4b.
Ions moving in a magnetic field are deflected at right angles
to these flux lines. Ions above the midplane of the cyclotron
are directed downward; those below the midplane are directed
upward. In this way an ion oscillates about the midplane
and vertical focusing is achieved.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></div>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

</a>
<span class="caption">Fig. 4.

(a) Plot of magnetic-field strength vs radius. The field
strength decreases gradually out to a radius of about 83-in.,
after which it falls off sharply. This point marks the
maximum usable radius for particle orbits. Further out
they are unstable.

(b) Magnetic flux lines are represented as broken arrows,
and focusing forces as solid arrows. An ion above the midplane
is directed downward, while an ion below the midplane
is directed upward.</span>
</div>

<p>Radial focusing is accomplished in a somewhat analogous
manner. If the magnetic field decreases with radius, radial
restoring forces are established. An ion at too large a
radius is directed inward, and an ion at too small a radius
is directed outward. In this fashion, the ion oscillates about
the synchronous orbit. Thus, radial focusing is achieved.</p>


<h4><a name="Vacuum_System" id="Vacuum_System"></a>Vacuum System</h4>

<p>The vacuum tank (acceleration chamber) is a steel box
20 × 25 ft and 4 ft high. It is evacuated to a pressure of
10<sup>-5</sup> millimeter of mercury (about one 100-millionth of
atmospheric pressure). The pumping equipment consists of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>six oil-diffusion pumps and four mechanical vacuum pumps.
The pumping speed of the six 20-in. oil-diffusion pumps is
a total of 20,000 liters/sec.</p>


<h4><a name="Ion_Source" id="Ion_Source"></a>Ion Source</h4>

<p>The ion source is a simple arc-type. Hydrogen gas is
allowed to leak into the ion-source enclosure near a tungsten
filament, which is heated to incandescence. Electrons emitted
by the filament knock off electrons from hydrogen atoms,
leaving free protons. The protons then escape into the
acceleration chamber through a hole in the ion-source
housing. Once inside, the protons are accelerated by the dee
potential.</p>

<p>Deuterons or alpha particles are obtained in a similar
fashion using deuterium or helium gas in place of hydrogen.</p>


<h4><a name="Radiofrequency_System" id="Radiofrequency_System"></a>Radiofrequency System</h4>

<p>The 184-inch synchrocyclotron has a single dee instead
of the double-dee arrangement described above for illustrative
purposes. The accelerating electric field is developed
between the dee and a dummy dee which is grounded to the
vacuum tank. Using a single dee does not change the principle
of operation, yet it offers the advantage of allowing
more space for auxiliary equipment inside the vacuum tank.
Also, the construction is much simpler. The dummy dee is
not essential for operation, but it does improve performance.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<span class="caption">Fig. 5. Radiofrequency cycle for accelerating protons. Sixty-four
such cycles are repeated each second.</span>
</div>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></div>
<p>Radiofrequency power is supplied to the dee by a vacuum-tube
oscillator. The frequency of oscillation must decrease
during the acceleration cycle, as indicated above. For protons,
the frequency at the start of acceleration is 36 megacycles
(Mc). At the end of acceleration the frequency is
only 18 Mc (see Fig. 5). This change in frequency is
achieved by varying the electrical capacitance in the tuned
circuit of the oscillator. (This is what you do when you dial
a different station on a radio.) This tuned circuit, which is
called the cyclotron resonator, is shown in Fig. 6.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a href="images/fig_6_1200.png">
<img src="images/fig_6_600.png" width="600" height="595" alt="" title="" />
</a>
<span class="caption">Fig. 6. Cyclotron resonator.</span>
</div>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></div>
<p>Because the frequency must change over such a wide
range (from 36 to 18 Mc), the electrical capacitance must
be varied by a factor of 20 to 1. This is done by a variable
capacitor of unique design. It resembles two giant tuning
forks. As the blades of the tuning forks vibrate, the capacitance
is alternately increased and decreased by the required
amount.</p>

<p>These two tuning forks must be kept in step with great
precision. This is to prevent the oscillator from exciting
lateral rf resonances. With a cyclotron of this size, this
is a problem. These resonances, if excited, would cause
loss of beam. The method for keeping the blades moving
together is as follows: The blades are made to vibrate
at their resonant frequency, which is approximately 64
cycles per second. One set of blades operates at its
natural frequency as a tuning-fork oscillator. The second
set of blades is driven from an amplified sample of the
signal from the first; its natural period is adjusted automatically
to equal that of the first. The amplitude of each
set is regulated to within 0.003 in.; the phase angle between
the blades is regulated to within 1 deg.</p>

<p>Ions are accelerated only when the radiofrequency is
decreasing (Fig. 5). The remaining portion of the cycle is
"dead time." Thus, 64 pulses, each of about 500 microseconds'
duration, are obtained every second. The average
ion current of a pulsed beam is much less than for a
continuous beam, such as that obtained from a conventional
cyclotron (see Table I). This is part of the price paid for
higher energies.</p>


<h4><a name="Internal_Targets_and_Beam_Extractor" id="Internal_Targets_and_Beam_Extractor"></a>
Internal Targets and Beam Extractor</h4>

<p>The simplest target is one placed inside the vacuum
tank where the circulating beam will strike it. The target
may be any substance that the physicist or chemist wants
to irradiate. The target material is attached to a movable
probe. If the experimenter wants to use the full-energy
beam, he places the target at the maximum usable radius
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>of the circulating beam (82 inches). However, if he desires
to use ions having less than the maximum energy, he inserts
the target further into the cyclotron so that it is
intercepted sooner.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 7. Plan view of the cyclotron, showing the method
for obtaining an external beam of protons, deuterons,
or alpha particles.</span>
</div>

<p>Some experiments require an external beam of protons,
deuterons, or alpha particles. A beam of this type can be
brought out of the machine by means of a LeCouteur regenerator
(Fig. 7). The construction of the regenerator is
very simple. It is made of a number of steel laminations of
various sizes. What the regenerator does is perturb the
magnetic field of the cyclotron at one radial position. Each
time the beam passes through the regenerator it receives
a kick. With each kick the beam builds up its radial amplitude,
until finally it enters a magnetic channel. This channel
focuses the beam and steers it outside the main magnetic
field. Once outside, the beam travels through an evacuated
tube, which is integral with the main vacuum tank. By
means of a steering magnet, the beam can be sent into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>either the physics cave or the medical cave. (These experimental
areas are called "caves" because they are rooms
inside the massive concrete shielding wall.)</p>

<p>Other experiments may require an external beam of mesons.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
A meson beam is obtained in the following way
(Fig. 8): A movable target such as a block of carbon is
placed inside the cyclotron near the end of the outward-spiraling
proton beam. When the proton beam hits this
target, a shower of mesons is produced. These mesons
are bent in various directions by the main magnetic field.
Some of them pass through a thin metal window in the
vacuum-tank wall and are focused by a magnetic lens into
a beam. This meson beam then travels through a hole in
the concrete shielding wall into the meson cave. The
maximum intensity of this extracted meson beam depends
on both the charge and energy desired. Beams of more than
100,000 mesons per second have been obtained through an
aperture 4 × 4 in. in the shielding wall.</p>

CYCLOTRON EXPERIMENTS</h3>


<h4><a name="Nuclear_Physics" id="Nuclear_Physics"></a>Nuclear Physics</h4>

<p>About 86% of the operating time of the 184-inch synchrocyclotron
is devoted to experiments in nuclear physics.
Most of the experiments study the production and interaction
of &pi; mesons. These particles are considered to be
essential factors in the intense but short-range forces that
bind the nucleus together. The three types of &pi; mesons are
designated according to their electric charge as &pi;<sup>+</sup>, &pi;<sup>0</sup>, and
&pi;<sup>-</sup>.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
These mesons materialize only in high-energy nuclear
collisions.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 8. Method for obtaining external meson beam.</span>
</div>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></div>
<p>Of great importance are those experiments that determine
the probability of producing each of the three types
of mesons in a nuclear collision. This type of experiment
is repeated for different beam energies and target elements.
Other experiments measure the energy and direction of
emission of &pi; mesons from a target.</p>

</div>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></div>
<p>A typical &pi;-meson experiment is represented in Fig. 9.
The purpose of this experiment was to detect the spin
directions of protons as they are knocked out of a liquid
hydrogen target by a &pi;-meson beam. (Like the earth, a
proton spins on its axis.) An extracted proton beam from
the cyclotron enters the physics cave from the left, striking
a polyethylene target and producing &pi; mesons. A beam of
these mesons is formed by a series of two bending magnets
and three focusing magnets. This beam passes through a
carbon absorber to remove unwanted particles. The meson
beam then strikes the liquid hydrogen target. A few of the
incoming mesons scatter, knocking protons out of the liquid
hydrogen. Scintillation counters at A and B record the passage
of a proton, thus defining its direction. The scattered
mesons are counted by a scintillation counter at C. A few
of the protons scatter off the carbon target and are detected
by counters at E and D. From the detection of such events,
the spin directions (polarization) of the recoil protons can
be analyzed. In this way, more is learned about the fundamental
&pi;-proton interaction.</p>

<p>Further studies of the interactions of &pi; mesons are
made in the meson cave. Other experiments performed there
are concerned with &mu; mesons. The &mu; meson (muon) is a
particle created in the decay of a &pi; meson and is the
principal constituent of cosmic rays striking the surface
of the earth. The muon is unstable, eventually undergoing
a radioactive decay into an electron. Although the muon
does not experience nuclear forces, it can interact weakly
with nuclei. The behavior of the muon is well understood,
but its role as one of the elementary particles is unknown.
That is, if the muon did not exist, what effect would this
have on the structure of matter? The answer to this question,
among others, is being sought by physicists using the
184-inch cyclotron.</p>


<h4><a name="Biophysics" id="Biophysics"></a>Biophysics</h4>

<p>Experiments in biophysics are conducted in the medical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>cave. In these the interest lies not in nuclear interactions
but in the effect of ionizing radiation on living tissue. High-energy
beams of particles can be used for selective destruction
of specific areas of the brain. This permits
physiological mapping of the functions of the brain in experimental
animals. It further offers a therapeutic approach
to the treatment of brain tumors. One of the important
investigational programs is concerned with the relationship
of the pituitary gland to the growth rate of certain cancers
and to some endocrine disorders.</p>


<h4><a name="Nuclear_Chemistry" id="Nuclear_Chemistry"></a>Nuclear Chemistry</h4>

<p>For techniques of radiochemistry to be employed successfully,
high interaction rates (and therefore high beam
intensities) are needed. For this reason, chemistry targets
are usually inserted right into the cyclotron so that they
can be bombarded directly by the circulating beam. After
the bombardment is completed the target is removed from
the cyclotron. It is then taken to a chemistry laboratory
and subjected to detailed chemical procedures. Individual
elements are removed, and the radioactive isotopes of
each element are identified by quantitative counting techniques.
In some cases a mass spectrometer is used to
analyze the products. Many deductions about the nature of
the breakup of the target nucleus can be drawn from the
pattern of the observed radioactive products. Sometimes
the nucleus splits almost in half. This is called fission.
More frequently smaller parts of the nucleus are split off.
Two general types of reactions, known as spallation and
fragmentation, are distinguished. One of the goals of this
research is to learn more about the constitution of the
nucleus and of the forces which bind the particles in the
interior of the nucleus.</p>
